## 🎯 Research Objective

Recommender systems often focus on prediction accuracy while neglecting interpretability.
This project aims to:
- Predict book ratings using machine learning techniques
- Analyze the factors influencing rating behavior
- Emphasize **interpretability** to support transparency and explainability
- Provide a reproducible research pipeline supporting a scientific publication
